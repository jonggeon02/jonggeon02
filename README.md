# 👊 Gun Park — Bold. Clean. Relentless.

안녕하세요! I'm **Gun Park** (not my real name 😉), a developer with a sharp edge — just like my namesake.  
Inspired by Korean strength, street style, and clean execution, I build code the way Jong Geon throws punches — precise and impactful.  
Currently crafting immersive VR experiences, sleek web apps, and AI-powered tools.
